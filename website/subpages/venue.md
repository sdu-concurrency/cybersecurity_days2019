### Directions
Buses 41, 44 and 72 run to the University.  Exit the bus at the last stop and walk along the parking lot in the direction of the building with circles on its facade.  Just before reaching that building there is a path to the right, between a smaller building and a bicycle parking lot. Follow that path, and turn left after the smaller building.  There is an overpass, and right afterwards a stairs to the right leading to entrance L. The XXX lecture room is after the entrance to the right.  (See map below.)

If you get lost, just enter any University building: they are all connected, and there are maps on most main doors.
