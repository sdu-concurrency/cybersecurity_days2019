CyberSecurity Days 2019 is the first edition of a two-day cyber security dissemination event to promote IT security in Denmark. The event is
funded by the [Centre for Cyber ​​Security](https://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/Pages/cfcs.aspx) of the [Ministry of Defence](https://fmn.dk/eng/Pages/frontpage.aspx) and held as a collaboration among danish educational and research  institutions (AAU, CBS, DTU, KEA, and SDU).

The CyberSecurity Days are designed with the primary goal to provide participants with cutting-edge, comprehensive knowledge on the main issues and best practices related to cyber security; useful to both private citizens and organisations. Through active lectures and practical exercises, the participants will gain and develop the necessary knowledge and skills to understand the concepts and the technologies for achieving security in IT systems---examples include threat analysis, avoidance, and mitigation (both at the technical and business level), as well as data security management (authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, etc.).

CyberSecurity Days also serve as a place where industry, public companies, students, and institutions can meet, discuss about cyber security and informally explore future collaborations. It is a special occasion to talk to experts on cyber security and network with professionals from industry, academia, and the public sector.

Edition 2019 of CyberSecurity Days will take place from October 22nd to October 23rd, 2019 at the [University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, 5230 Odense M, Denmark](/attending).
