The Cybersecurity Days 2019 is the first two-day cybersecurity dissemination event
to promote IT security in Denmark. The Cybersecurity Days serve
as a place where educational institutions, industry, public companies, and
students can meet, discuss about IT cybersecurity and have opportunities to
informally discuss security and possible future collaborations. It is a 
special occasion to talk to experts
and enthusiasts on cybersecurity and grow your network in industry,
academia, and the public sector.

The Cybersecurity Days is held as a collaboration between educational and
research institutions (KEA, AAU, SDU, CBS, DTU) and funded by
the Center for Cyber ​​Security of the Ministry of Defense.

The Cybersecurity Days event will take place from October 22nd to October 23rd,
2019 and will include lectures and exercises to provide the participants knowledge about
cybersecurity to use on daily basis. There are no strict prerequisites for
attendance, even though the event will be mainly targeted to people working
in information and communication technology fields.
The lectures will be given either in Danish or in English (in case
of attendees speaking only English, lectures will be given in English).

Participants are asked to bring their own laptop.
All teaching materials will be available online.

The Cybersecurity Days have a participation fee of 1500 DKK that includes meals,
coffee breaks, and a reception held on the 22nd of October at the end of the
first day lectures. They take place at the University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, 5230 Odense M, Denmark.

Please note that places are limited and will be allocated on a first come first served basis.
