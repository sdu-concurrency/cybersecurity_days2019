### Directions
There is a direct bus (lines 41 and 44) from the centre of Odense (where the train/bus station is) to the University running every 30 minutes. The ride takes about 25 minutes.

Directions from the bus stop of the University Campus (<a target="_blank" href="https://clients.mapsindoors.com/sdu/573f26e4bc1f571b08094312/route/destination/563cb88d423b7d0540c99fc1">click here to see an interactive map of the path</a>):

- walk along the parking lot in the direction of the building with circles on its facade;  
- turn right at the first lane and enter the university building at entrance J/53; 
- walk all the corridor (Bogene) until it crosses the main hallway (Gydehutten);
- turn left and continue walking until you meet the intersection with the next corridor (Krogene);
- turn right and walk all the way to the end of the corridor;
- the BMB seminar room is the last room on the left (see map below).

If you get lost, just enter any University building: they are all connected, and there are maps on most main doors.
