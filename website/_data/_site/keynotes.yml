  title: Domain-Specific Service Decomposition with Microservices API Patterns
  affiliation: University of Applied Sciences of Eastern Switzerland, Rapperswil (HSR FHO)
  date: February 19th, 2019, afternoon session
  abstract: |
    Service orientation is a key enabler for cloud-native application
    development.
    [Microservices](https://www.ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=15266&L=4) have
    emerged as a state-of-the-art implementation approach for the realization
    of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) style, promoting modern
    software engineering and deployment practices such as containerization,
    continuous delivery, and DevOps. Designing (micro-)services interfaces' to
    be expressive, responsive, and evolvable is challenging. For instance,
    deciding for suited granularities is a complex task resolving many
    conflicting forces; one size does not fit all. [Domain-Driven Design
    (DDD)](https://www.ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=15666&L=4) can be applied to
    identify and specify service boundaries. However, service designers seek
    concrete, actionable guidance going beyond high-level advice such as “turn
    each bounded context into a microservice”. Interface signatures and
    message representations need particular attention as their structures
    influence the service quality characteristics. This presentation first
    recapitulates prevalent SOA principles, [microservices
    tenets](http://rdcu.be/mJPz) and DDD patterns. It then reports on the
    ongoing compilation of complementary Microservices API Patterns (MAP) and
    proposes a set of pattern-based API refactorings for service
    decomposition. Finally, the presentation highlights some of the related
    research and development challenges.

  title: Understandable Microservices
  affiliation: University of Southern Denmark
  date: February 20th, 2019, morning session
  abstract: |
    Microservices come at a price: they have to be integrated to get a
    meaningful application. This motivated the creation of tools that make
    integration easier. Today, we spend more time developing integration than
    actual applications, so this development could not have come at a better
    time. Enter Jolie, a microservice-oriented programming language. By
    offering native linguistic features for composing microservices, Jolie has
    become a swiss army knife that can be used by integration ninjas and wise
    software designers that plan for maintanable software. To explore how
    microservices and Jolie can make us productive with integration, we'll
    develop microservices for a concrete business idea: a publishing platform
    for sharing Chuck Norris jokes. Technically, we'll create an API gateway
    for two different third-party Internet websites, integrate their
    behaviours, and ultimately get what we want without having to host either
    of them. Would you write object-oriented software without an
    object-oriented language? Ask yourself again, but for microservices, after
    you see this talk.

  title: Factory of Things - Using Microservices for Data Processing and IoT
  affiliation: com2m GmbH
  date: February 21th, 2019, afternoon session
  abstract: |
    Industrial devices and machines, ranging from lights over elevators to complete 
    factories, are producing large amounts of data. Some of it is used to grant 
    simple ad-hoc monitoring and control capabilities, but a lot of this valuable 
    resource ends up discarded due to the lack of a comprehensive data processing infrastructure.
    Microservices provide a reliable and performant architecture for the Internet
    of Things (IoT) to connect devices on a large scale, which provides a path 
    to collect and analyse the flood of accumulating application data. At com2m, 
    a containerized microservice-based IoT platform was developed leveraging graph 
    and document databases, and modern web technologies. We present the Factory of Things 
    as a showcase that demonstrates the real-world integration of a manufacturing line
    powered by programmable logic controllers. The IoT platform enables new data processing 
    possibilities to monitor devices and enables the development of rich data-based services.

  title: Engineering Reliability
  affiliation: Google
  date: February 20st, 2019, morning session
  abstract: |
    How do you scale up a service, so it can serve millions (or billions!) of 
    users around the globe, make it reliable and fast while maintaining 
    development speed and change safety? This talk introduces Site Reliability 
    Engineering (SRE) at Google, explaining its purpose and describing the 
    techniques it uses and the challenges it addresses. SRE teams manage 
    Google's many services and properties, plus all the brand new Cloud 
    infrastructure from our offices worldwide. They draw upon Linux based 
    computing resources that are distributed in several data centres around the 
    globe to deploy, manage, and serve globally available services four billions 
    of users.

  title: Build Fashionable Container Systems with Microservices, Clouds, and Kubernetes
  affiliation: bee42 solutions gmbh
  date: February 21st, 2019, afternoon session
  abstract: |
    Transform your organization and systems so that they no longer need an
    end-state. Modern clouds and the container technology help you to build
    self-healing autonomous scalable systems around the globe. The Cloud
    Native Computing Foundation ecosystem offers you many features to setup
    and manage complex cloud-native container systems. Serverless or
    microservice architectures need a lot of glue infrastructure components.
    In this talk I will show you some automation practices, such as
    infrastructure as code, release automation, and container orchestration.
    We build container systems in conjunction with Kubernetes and Clouds. As a
    developer you will learn how you can easily control your stage
    environments, reuse setups, and how to release your complete application
    stack with cloud-native technologies.
