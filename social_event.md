We are organising two social events in the evening of the second conference day (**Wednesday, February 20th**): a [**tour of the city**](#dortmund-city-tour) of Dortmund, starting at 18:30, and a [**social dinner**](#social-dinner) starting at 20:00. Both events are not included in the registration fee of the conference. Participants can choose to participate to any event and pay for them directly on site.
